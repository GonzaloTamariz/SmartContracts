# Smart Contract External Data Integration

## Overview
Smart Contracts, residing on a blockchain, execute predefined actions based on specific conditions. However, integrating external data into these contracts poses challenges due to their simultaneous execution across nodes. This project delves into methods for incorporating off-chain data into Smart Contracts.

## Objective
The primary goal of this project is to explore diverse approaches enabling Smart Contracts to interact with external data sources without compromising their decentralized nature. By mitigating the limitations of solely on-chain execution, we aim to broaden the potential use cases and functionalities of Smart Contracts.

## Key Features
- **Off-chain Data Feeds**: Investigate mechanisms for securely accessing external data.
- **Data Oracles**: Explore oracle solutions to facilitate data integration into Smart Contracts.
- **Decentralized Oracle Networks**: Assess decentralized networks for reliable and tamper-resistant data feeds.
- **Implementation Examples**: Provide code examples and demonstrations for integrating off-chain data.

## Methods Explored
1. **Oracle Integration**: Utilize trusted oracles to relay external data.
2. **API Integration**: Investigate direct API connections for real-time data sourcing.
3. **Decentralized Oracles**: Assess decentralized networks like Chainlink for robust data feeds.
4. **Off-chain Computation**: Explore techniques for performing computations off-chain and using results in contracts.
